Git = local
GitHub = remote directory 

After installing 

Configuring Git on a Terminal - 
codes: 
1. git config --global user.name "Git_accnt_username" :- connects to the username in GitHub
2. git config --global user.email "Git_accnt_mail" :- To verify both username and email combo
3. git config list - List the details of the configuration of the linked account

Clone - clones a repository from GitHub to the local machine.

Status - Shows how many updates and files are modified since made. (Tracks all the changes)

--

add - moves file to staging area
commit - records the changes in file

remove - code used is rm
Imagine tracking a file which was not meant to be, rm helps them untrack again
Syntax	~ git rm --cheched -r <File>

use- ls or dir to show all the files within directory
** To show hidden files we can use > ls -hidden and other attributes

____________________________________

Types of files in git 
1. untracked - never committed before and hence git doesn't have idea about the content of the file.
2. modified - committed earlier
3. staged - ready to be committed
4. unmodified - no changes observed

____________________________________

To see the changes made to a repo on GitHub - 
just click the committed msg on - GitHub file 
it will show you a history of all the commits.

*****

push command - 
basic code - git push

additionally we can use git push origin main

~ Concept - 
git works on - local repo
GitHub on - remote repo

So, the default remote repo is - ORIGIN
             and the branch is - MAIN
