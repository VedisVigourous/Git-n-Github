Undoing unnecessary changes made by mistake:

Case 1: Staged branch - for those files which are added but not committed 
A. reloads the file uploaded within the github repo undoing current changes made in local repo.
    ~ git reset 

B. to reset a particular file
    ~ git reset <file_name>

Case 2: Undoing commits - 
    ~ git reset HEAD~1 
    i.e. if i have done 3 commits for a file it will go back to the 2nd on doing this.

** To check commits we can use { git log }

Case 3: Undoing a specific commit or many commits
    ~ git reset <commit_hashcode>
    i.e. if we write hashcode of 2nd commit, and we are on 5th we will rollback to 2nd commit

Note: if we want to change the code as well with the commits we use --hard 
    ~ git reset --hard <commit_hashcode>
